# Ice-Extent-Prediction-using-LSTM
Here I've used the ice extent dataset provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in order to predict the future extent. The dataset contains extent details for both, north and south hemisphere. However, I've trained my model for the northern hemisphere only. The model used is LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).
